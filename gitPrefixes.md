# Git Commit Prefixes

This section provides a list of commonly used Git commit prefixes and their corresponding meanings. These prefixes can be used to categorize and provide context to your commit messages, making it easier to understand the purpose of each commit.

The prefixes include:

- `✨ feat`: for new features or enhancements
- `🐛 fix`: for bug fixes
- `♻️ refactor`: for code refactoring or restructuring
- `📝 docs`: for documentation updates
- `🧪 test`: for adding or modifying tests
- `🚀 init`: for initial project setup or initialization
- `🎨 style`: for code style or formatting changes
- `👷 ci`: for continuous integration configuration changes
- `🚧 wip`: for work in progress commits
- `🔧 chore`: for general maintenance or miscellaneous tasks
- `🔀 merge`: for merge commits

Each prefix is followed by an optional scope and a subject, which provide additional information about the commit.

Below the list of prefixes, there is an example of each prefix without a scope, ready to be used in commit messages.

Use these prefixes to improve the clarity and consistency of your commit messages, making it easier for you and your team to understand the purpose and impact of each commit.

Brief Example:

```
✨ feat(scope?): subject
🐛 fix(scope?): subject
♻️ refactor(scope?): subject
📝 docs(scope?): subject
🧪 test(scope?): subject
🚀 init(scope?): subject
🎨 style(scope?): subject
👷 ci(scope?): subject
🚧 wip(scope?): subject
🔧 chore(scope?): subject
🔀 merge(scope?): subject
```
